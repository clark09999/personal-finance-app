Goal:
Recreate a full-stack personal finance app MVP with both frontend and backend built natively inside Replit. The backend will use Supabase as the database, and the frontend will be a React dashboard-based interface. Code must be clean, modular, and ready for later AI integration.

App Overview

Purpose: Track transactions, set budgets, and visualize spending trends.

Architecture: Full-stack JS app with:

Frontend: React + Vite

Backend: Node.js (Express) + Supabase SDK

Database: Supabase (tables: transactions, categories, budgets, goals)

Core Features (Phase 1 MVP)

Dashboard

Display total spending, remaining budget, goal progress.

Show alerts for overspending.

Placeholder box for future AI insights.

Transaction Management

CRUD operations (add, edit, delete, view transactions).

Filters: by category and date range.

Sync with Supabase backend endpoints.

Budget Setup

Create, view, and edit monthly budgets.

Progress bar per category (budget used vs. remaining).

Reports & Analytics

Charts for category breakdown, monthly trend, and savings goals.

Dynamic chart.js or Recharts integration.

Backend Requirements

Framework: Express.js

Use Supabase JS client for DB access.

Endpoints:

/transactions → CRUD

/summary → Spending breakdown

/budgets → Budget CRUD

/goals → Track progress

/export → Export data as CSV/JSON

JWT authentication (use Supabase auth).

Modular structure (routes, services, middleware, config).

Environment variables: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY.

Frontend Requirements

React + TailwindCSS.

Pages/Components:

Dashboard.jsx

Transactions.jsx

Budgets.jsx

Reports.jsx

Include:

State management (React Context or Redux if needed).

API integration with backend endpoints.

Recharts for data visualization.

Comment each component clearly for future AI expansion.

Additional Clauses

Comment all core logic for AI explainability.

Keep UI minimal but data-rich (dashboard layout, sidebar navigation).

Add clear separation between UI state and data logic.

Include placeholder function generateAIInsights() that will later connect to AI modules.

Ensure codebase runs instantly in Replit (no external setup).

Output Expected

A working full-stack Replit project (frontend + backend + database setup).

All environment variables and setup instructions visible in comments.

Frontend connected to backend endpoints.

Example demo data preloaded for testing.

After Build

When finished, summarize:

Directory structure

Key dependencies

Endpoint list

Frontend component map
